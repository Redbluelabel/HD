There are a few steps involved.

Firstly. Download the data from GEO database. Please see the file data for instructions

Second. Execute the file “Part A”. This file will estimate the forecasting accuracy of each CpG independently
The researchers then needs to select a cutting level for the accuracy and remove the CpGS that do not reach it.

Third. Execute the file “Part B”. This is the second part of the algorithm that carries out the combinatorial analysis. It needs as an input the CpGs already filtered (using “Part A”).
